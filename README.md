# Malaria-ClassificationUsing-CNN
This Project aims to develop a computer vision solution for detecting malaria parasites in blood smear images is a GUI based application which uses a custom CNN model(Accuracy: 96.02%) to predict if an uploaded cell image is parasitized or uninfected. At first a Deep learning model was trained and tested in Google Colab based on the dataset obtained from kaggle, then in order to give it a user interface, tkinter module in Python is used.
